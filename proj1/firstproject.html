                <p><i>"We were once computer science studets sitting right where you are. We were lost and never really able to 
                    get the help we needed. Yes, there were advisors to help us choose what classes we needed to take, but they never really understood 
                    what it felt like to be a student taking Calculus 2, Analysis of Algorithms and Robitcs all at once. Now we are here to help make your life easier. We want to 
                    help the computer science community get the help they deserve and to show them that they are not alone!"              ~Unis Gabbar (President)</i> </p>
